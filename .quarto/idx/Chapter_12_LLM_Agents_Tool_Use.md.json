[Calls weather API]\n3. [Gets current weather data]\n4. \"It's currently 72¬∞F and sunny in your location.\"\n\nThe agent can take actions, not just generate text! üå§Ô∏è\n```\n\n#### Key Characteristics of AI Agents\n```\n‚úÖ Autonomy: Can make decisions and take actions independently\n‚úÖ Goal-oriented: Works toward specific objectives\n‚úÖ Tool use: Can interact with external systems and APIs\n‚úÖ Planning: Can break down complex tasks into steps\n‚úÖ Memory: Maintains state across interactions\n‚úÖ Adaptability: Learns from feedback and adjusts approach\n```\n\n#### The Agent Analogy: Personal Assistant üë®‚Äçüíº\n```\nThink of an AI agent like a highly capable personal assistant:\n\nHuman assistant capabilities:\n- Answer questions (knowledge)\n- Make phone calls (communication)\n- Schedule meetings (calendar management)\n- Research information (web browsing)\n- Send emails (correspondence)\n- Book travel (planning and execution)\n\nAI agent capabilities:\n- Answer questions (LLM reasoning)\n- Call APIs (function calling)\n- Update databases (data management)\n- Search the web (information retrieval)\n- Send notifications (system integration)\n- Execute workflows (task automation)\n```\n\n### The Agent Architecture\n\n#### Basic Agent Loop\n```\n1. PERCEIVE: Understand the current situation\n   - Read user input\n   - Check current state/context\n   - Assess available tools and resources\n\n2. PLAN: Decide what to do\n   - Break down the goal into steps\n   - Choose appropriate tools and actions\n   - Consider potential obstacles\n\n3. ACT: Execute the plan\n   - Call functions and APIs\n   - Interact with external systems\n   - Modify state or environment\n\n4. OBSERVE: Check the results\n   - Evaluate success/failure\n   - Update understanding\n   - Decide if more action is needed\n\n5. REPEAT: Continue until goal is achieved\n```\n\n#### Example: Booking a Restaurant Reservation\n```\nUser: \"Book me a table for 2 at a good Italian restaurant tonight at 7 PM\"\n\nAgent reasoning:\n1. PERCEIVE: User wants dinner reservation, 2 people, Italian food, tonight, 7 PM\n2. PLAN: Need to find Italian restaurants ‚Üí check availability ‚Üí make reservation\n3. ACT: Search restaurants API ‚Üí filter by cuisine and rating ‚Üí check availability\n4. OBSERVE: Found 3 restaurants with availability\n5. PLAN: Choose best option ‚Üí make reservation\n6. ACT: Call reservation API ‚Üí confirm booking\n7. OBSERVE: Reservation confirmed\n8. RESPOND: \"I've booked you a table for 2 at Luigi's Italian Restaurant tonight at 7 PM. Confirmation number: ABC123\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 12.2 Function Calling: Giving LLMs Superpowers ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\n### What is Function Calling?\n\n#### The Breakthrough Innovation\n```\nFunction calling allows LLMs to:\n- Call external APIs and services\n- Execute code and scripts\n- Interact with databases\n- Control other software systems\n- Perform real-world actions\n\nIt's like giving the AI \"hands\" to manipulate the digital world! üôå\n```\n\n#### How Function Calling Works\n```\n1. Define Available Functions:\n   - Describe what each function does\n   - Specify required parameters\n   - Include examples of usage\n\n2. LLM Decides When to Call:\n   - Analyzes user request\n   - Determines if external action needed\n   - Chooses appropriate function\n\n3. Function Execution:\n   - System executes the function call\n   - Returns results to the LLM\n   - LLM incorporates results into response\n\n4. Response Generation:\n   - LLM uses function results\n   - Generates natural language response\n   - May trigger additional function calls\n```\n\n### Function Definition and Schema\n\n#### JSON Schema for Functions\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n  \"description\": \"Get current weather information for a location\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"location\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\"\n      },\n      \"unit\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"enum\": [\"celsius\", \"fahrenheit\"],\n        \"description\": \"The temperature unit to use\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"location\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### More Complex Function Examples\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"send_email\",\n  \"description\": \"Send an email to specified recipients\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"to\": {\n        \"type\": \"array\",\n        \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"description\": \"List of recipient email addresses\"\n      },\n      \"subject\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"Email subject line\"\n      },\n      \"body\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"Email content\"\n      },\n      \"attachments\": {\n        \"type\": \"array\",\n        \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n        \"description\": \"List of file paths to attach\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"to\", \"subject\", \"body\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Function Call Examples\n\n#### Simple Weather Query\n```\nUser: \"What's the weather like in Tokyo?\"\n\nLLM reasoning:\n\"I need to get weather information for Tokyo. I'll use the get_weather function.\"\n\nFunction call:\n{\n  \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"location\": \"Tokyo, Japan\",\n    \"unit\": \"celsius\"\n  }\n}\n\nFunction result:\n{\n  \"temperature\": 22,\n  \"condition\": \"partly cloudy\",\n  \"humidity\": 65,\n  \"wind_speed\": 8\n}\n\nLLM response:\n\"The weather in Tokyo is currently 22¬∞C with partly cloudy conditions. The humidity is 65% and wind speed is 8 km/h.\"\n```\n\n#### Complex Multi-Step Task\n```\nUser: \"Schedule a meeting with John for tomorrow at 2 PM and send him a calendar invite\"\n\nLLM reasoning:\n\"I need to: 1) Check calendar availability 2) Create meeting 3) Send invite\"\n\nStep 1 - Check availability:\nFunction call: check_calendar_availability(\"tomorrow\", \"2:00 PM\", \"1 hour\")\nResult: Available\n\nStep 2 - Create meeting:\nFunction call: create_meeting({\n  \"title\": \"Meeting with John\",\n  \"date\": \"2024-01-15\",\n  \"time\": \"14:00\",\n  \"duration\": 60,\n  \"attendees\": [\"john@email.com\"]\n})\nResult: Meeting created with ID: meet_123\n\nStep 3 - Send invite:\nFunction call: send_calendar_invite(\"meet_123\", [\"john@email.com\"])\nResult: Invite sent successfully\n\nLLM response:\n\"I've scheduled a meeting with John for tomorrow at 2 PM and sent him a calendar invite. The meeting is confirmed for January 15th, 2024 at 2:00 PM.\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 12.3 Agent Reasoning Patterns üß†\n\n### ReAct: Reasoning and Acting\n\n#### The ReAct Framework\n```\nReAct = Reasoning + Acting in an interleaved manner\n\nPattern:\nThought: [Reasoning about what to do]\nAction: [Execute function/tool]\nObservation: [Result of the action]\nThought: [Reason about the result]\nAction: [Next action if needed]\n...\nFinal Answer: [Complete response]\n```\n\n#### ReAct Example: Research Task\n```\nUser: \"What's the population of the largest city in Japan?\"\n\nThought: I need to find the largest city in Japan first, then get its population.\n\nAction: search_web(\"largest city in Japan\")\n\nObservation: Tokyo is the largest city in Japan with over 13 million people in the city proper and about 37 million in the metropolitan area.\n\nThought: Tokyo is the largest city. Let me get more recent and precise population data.\n\nAction: get_city_statistics(\"Tokyo, Japan\", \"population\")\n\nObservation: {\"city\": \"Tokyo\", \"population_city\": 13964000, \"population_metro\": 37435000, \"year\": 2023}\n\nThought: I have the current population data for Tokyo. The city proper has about 14 million people.\n\nFinal Answer: The largest city in Japan is Tokyo, with a population of approximately 13.96 million people in the city proper (as of 2023). The greater metropolitan area has about 37.4 million people.\n```\n\n### Plan-and-Execute Agents\n\n#### High-Level Planning Approach\n```\nStep 1: PLAN\n- Break down complex task into subtasks\n- Create ordered sequence of steps\n- Identify required tools for each step\n\nStep 2: EXECUTE\n- Execute each step in sequence\n- Use tools and functions as needed\n- Monitor progress and adapt plan\n\nStep 3: VERIFY\n- Check if goal was achieved\n- Evaluate quality of results\n- Re-plan if necessary\n```\n\n#### Example: Travel Planning Agent\n```\nUser: \"Plan a 3-day trip to Paris for 2 people, budget $2000\"\n\nPLANNING PHASE:\nPlan:\n1. Research flights to Paris\n2. Find accommodation for 3 nights\n3. Research popular attractions and activities\n4. Create daily itinerary\n5. Calculate total costs\n6. Make reservations if approved\n\nEXECUTION PHASE:\n\nStep 1: Research flights\nAction: search_flights(\"current_location\", \"Paris\", \"departure_date\", 2)\nResult: Found flights $600 per person round trip\n\nStep 2: Find accommodation\nAction: search_hotels(\"Paris\", \"check_in_date\", 3, 2, max_price=200)\nResult: Found hotel $150 per night\n\nStep 3: Research attractions\nAction: get_attraction_info(\"Paris\", top_attractions=true)\nResult: List of must-see places with prices\n\nStep 4: Create itinerary\nAction: create_itinerary(attractions, 3_days, preferences)\nResult: Day-by-day schedule\n\nStep 5: Calculate costs\nTotal: Flights $1200 + Hotel $450 + Activities $300 = $1950 (within budget!)\n\nFinal Answer: \"I've planned a 3-day Paris trip for 2 people within your $2000 budget...\"\n```\n\n### Self-Reflection and Error Correction\n\n#### Learning from Mistakes\n```\nWhen actions fail or produce unexpected results:\n\n1. ANALYZE: What went wrong?\n2. ADAPT: How can I adjust my approach?\n3. RETRY: Execute with improved strategy\n\nExample:\nAction: book_restaurant(\"Luigi's\", \"tonight\", 8_people)\nObservation: Error - Restaurant fully booked\n\nThought: Luigi's is full. Let me try alternative approaches.\n\nAction: search_restaurants(\"Italian\", \"tonight\", 8_people, \"available\")\nObservation: Found 3 restaurants with availability\n\nThought: Good, I have alternatives. Let me book the highest-rated one.\n\nAction: book_restaurant(\"Mama Mia's\", \"tonight\", 8_people)\nObservation: Booking confirmed for 8 PM\n\nSelf-reflection improves success rates! üéØ\n```\n\n---\n\n## 12.4 Multi-Agent Systems üë•\n\n### When One Agent Isn't Enough\n\n#### Scenarios for Multi-Agent Systems\n```\n‚úÖ Complex tasks requiring diverse expertise\n‚úÖ Parallel processing of independent subtasks\n‚úÖ Specialized roles (researcher, writer, reviewer)\n‚úÖ Collaborative problem-solving\n‚úÖ Quality control through multiple perspectives\n```\n\n#### Agent Specialization Example\n```\nTask: \"Create a comprehensive marketing report for our new product\"\n\nRESEARCH AGENT:\n- Gathers market data and competitor information\n- Analyzes industry trends\n- Collects customer feedback\n\nDATA ANALYSIS AGENT:\n- Processes numerical data\n- Creates charts and visualizations\n- Calculates statistics and projections\n\nWRITING AGENT:\n- Synthesizes information into coherent report\n- Ensures proper structure and flow\n- Adapts tone for target audience\n\nREVIEW AGENT:\n- Fact-checks information\n- Ensures consistency and quality\n- Suggests improvements\n\nEach agent has specialized tools and expertise! üé≠\n```\n\n### Agent Communication Patterns\n\n#### Hierarchical Communication\n```\nCOORDINATOR AGENT (Manager)\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Research Agent\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Analysis Agent\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Writing Agent\n\nCommunication flow:\n1.

Convert experiences to text descriptions\n2. Generate embeddings for semantic search\n3. Retrieve relevant memories based on current context\n4. Use retrieved memories to inform decisions\n\nBenefits:\n‚úÖ Semantic similarity matching\n‚úÖ Scalable storage and retrieval\n‚úÖ Natural integration with RAG systems\n```\n\n#### Structured Memory\n```\nStore memories in structured format (database/knowledge graph):\n\nUser Profile:\n- name: \"John Smith\"\n- preferences: {\"cuisine\": [\"Italian\", \"Japanese\"], \"budget\": \"moderate\"}\n- history: [list of past interactions]\n\nTask Memory:\n- completed_tasks: [successful strategies and outcomes]\n- failed_attempts: [what didn't work and why]\n\nBenefits:\n‚úÖ Precise querying and filtering\n‚úÖ Complex relationships and constraints\n‚úÖ Efficient updates and maintenance\n```\n\n### Memory Management\n\n#### Forgetting and Pruning\n```\nChallenge: Memory can't grow indefinitely\n\nStrategies:\n1. Time-based decay: Older memories become less accessible\n2. Importance-based retention: Keep only significant events\n3. Compression: Summarize old detailed memories\n4. User-controlled: Let users decide what to remember/forget\n\nExample policy:\n- Keep detailed memory for last 30 days\n- Summarize and compress 30-90 day memories  \n- Keep only major events/preferences beyond 90 days\n- Never forget explicit user preferences without permission\n```\n\n#### Privacy and Security\n```\nMemory privacy considerations:\n‚úÖ Explicit consent for personal data storage\n‚úÖ User control over memory deletion\n‚úÖ Secure storage and access controls\n‚úÖ Transparency about what's remembered\n‚úÖ Data minimization principles\n\nExample user controls:\n- \"Forget everything about my medical information\"\n- \"Remember my work preferences but not personal details\"\n- \"Show me what you know about me\"\n- \"Delete all memories older than 6 months\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 12.6 Real-World Agent Applications üåç\n\n### Personal Productivity Agent\n\n#### Capabilities\n```\nDaily Tasks:\n- Schedule management and optimization\n- Email sorting and response drafting\n- Task prioritization and reminders\n- Meeting preparation and follow-up\n\nAdvanced Features:\n- Learn personal work patterns\n- Predict scheduling conflicts\n- Suggest efficiency improvements\n- Integrate with all productivity tools\n\nExample interaction:\nUser: \"I have a busy week coming up\"\nAgent: \"I see you have 12 meetings scheduled.
